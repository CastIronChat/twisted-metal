## Development

Getting started on Windows:

*Easiest to screen-share and ask one of us to walk you through the list.*

- install VSCode: <https://code.visualstudio.com/>
- install Git for Windows: <https://gitforwindows.org/>
  - The installer asks you a lot of options.  Ask one of us for help.
- install the recommended VSCode extensions
  - VSCode should prompt for this when you open our code.
  - Alternatively, open the "Extensions" sidebar, type `@recommended` into the
  search box, and install the items in that list.
- Install the latest Python 3
  - VSCode's python extension should prompt you with a button to do this.
  - Alternatively, find it in the Windows Store: "Python 3.10"
- Install Python dependencies:

    ```
    pip install black
    ```

Restart VSCode to detect installed changes.
