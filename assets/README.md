## Master list of assets

Every asset: art, sound, etc -- should be paired with a link to their source.

If we made it ourselves, then we should still include it and put "original" for the source.

### Why we do this

Two reasons:

- If we need to download matching assets from the same source in the future. For example, we added HUD icons for players 1 and 2, then later had to go back and download matching icons for players 3 and 4.

- If/when we release this game (itch?), we may need to verify that
all assets have compatible licenses: creative commons, public domain, something
like that.
