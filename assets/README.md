## Master list of assets

Every asset: art, sound, etc -- should be paired with a link to their source.

If we made it ourselves, then we should still include it and put "original" for the source.

If we lost the download links, then we should still include it and put "unknown" for the source.

### Why we do this

Two reasons:

- If we need to download matching assets from the same source in the future. For example, we added HUD icons for players 1 and 2, then later had to go back and download matching icons for players 3 and 4.

- If/when we release this game (itch?), we may need to verify that
all assets have compatible licenses: creative commons, public domain, something
like that.
